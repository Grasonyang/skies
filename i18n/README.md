This folder contains internationalization artifacts generated by the automation step.

Files:
- inventory.json: list of source strings found in the repo with suggested keys and priorities.
- src/locales/zh-TW.json: Traditional Chinese translations (initial import from source).
- src/locales/en.json: English translations (initial draft).

Next steps:
1. Replace hardcoded strings in components with useTranslation() and keys from inventory.json.
2. Add unit tests covering i18n outputs and snapshot tests for both zh-TW and en locales.
3. Work iteratively on remaining P0 and P1 items in inventory.json.

Provider implementation notes:
- A lightweight i18n provider is implemented to avoid external dependency issues with Next.js v15.
- Server-side provider injects messages into window.__I18N_MESSAGES__ and window.__I18N_LOCALE__.
- Client components should use `useTranslation()` from `src/lib/i18n.tsx`.
